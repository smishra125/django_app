There are three app in this project, one is exam, second is for testapp, and the one is the BRMapp(for Book Record Management).
In the third BRMapp, I have added the admin pages and worked with models with the introduction of HTML and css pages.
The exam and testapp is for understanding puposes and is simple.
Hope this would do some help in your projects.
